### **Comparison of Collision Resolution Techniques in Hashing**  

| **Aspect** | **Separate Chaining (Open Hashing)** | **Linear Probing (Closed Hashing)** | **Quadratic Probing (Closed Hashing)** | **Double Hashing (Closed Hashing)** |
|------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Basic Concept** | Uses a **linked list (or BST)** at each hash index to store multiple keys. | Searches **sequentially** for the next empty slot when a collision occurs. | Uses a **quadratic function** to probe for the next available slot. | Uses a **second hash function** to determine the step size for probing. |
| **Memory Usage** | **Higher** due to additional linked lists/BSTs at each index. | **Lower** as all elements are stored in the main hash table. | **Lower**, same as Linear Probing but avoids clustering. | **Lower**, uses two hash functions but no extra storage. |
| **Load Factor Impact (α = n/m)** | Can handle **α > 1**, as elements can grow within lists. | **Must be < 1** to maintain performance. | **Must be < 0.5** to ensure successful insertion. | **Must be < 0.7** to avoid excessive probing. |
| **Insertion Time Complexity** | **O(1) Best, O(1+α) Avg, O(n) Worst** (if all elements hash to the same bucket). | **O(1) Best, O(1/(1-α)) Avg, O(n) Worst** (if the table is too full). | **O(1) Best, O(1/(1-α)) Avg, O(n) Worst** (if table size is not prime). | **O(1) Best, O(1/(1-α)) Avg, O(n) Worst** (if α is high). |
| **Search Time Complexity** | **O(1+α) Avg, O(n) Worst** (depends on chain length). | **O(1) Best, O(1/(1-α)) Avg, O(n) Worst** (due to clustering). | **O(1) Best, O(1/(1-α)) Avg, O(n) Worst** (due to secondary clustering). | **O(1) Best, O(1/(1-α)) Avg, O(n) Worst** (avoids clustering but extra computation). |
| **Collision Handling** | Uses **linked lists** to store multiple items in the same index. | Uses **sequential probing**, increasing index by 1. | Uses **quadratic probing** (i.e., \( h(k, i) = (h(k) + i^2) \mod m \)). | Uses **double hashing** \( h(k, i) = (h_1(k) + i \times h_2(k)) \mod m \). |
| **Clustering Problem** | **No clustering** (since linked lists handle collisions). | **Primary Clustering** (consecutive filled slots slow down searches). | **Secondary Clustering** (keys with the same initial hash probe the same locations). | **No clustering**, since step size varies per key. |
| **Resizing Strategy** | **No rehashing needed**, just increase list size. | **Rehashing required** when load factor increases. | **Rehashing required** when load factor increases. | **Rehashing required** when load factor increases. |
| **Best Use Case** | Best for **dynamic insertions** (e.g., **databases, dictionaries**). | Best for **small, dense hash tables** (e.g., **cache storage**). | Best for **moderate load factors** where clustering needs to be reduced. | Best for **fast retrieval with a well-designed hash function**. |
| **Overall Performance** | **Best when memory is available**. Avoids clustering but uses extra memory. | **Fastest when load factor is low**, but suffers from **primary clustering**. | **Improved performance over linear probing**, but **secondary clustering still exists**. | **Best performance for Open Addressing**, avoids clustering but has extra computation overhead. |

## **Collision Resolution Techniques in Hashing**
When two keys map to the same index in a **hash table**, a **collision** occurs. To resolve these collisions, we use **collision resolution techniques**.

### **Two main approaches**:
1. **Separate Chaining (Open Hashing)** – Uses linked lists (or other structures) to store multiple elements at the same index.
2. **Open Addressing (Closed Hashing)** – Stores all elements **inside** the hash table itself and finds an alternate slot when a collision occurs.

---

## **1. Separate Chaining (Open Hashing)**  
Instead of storing only **one element** per index, each index **stores a linked list** (or another data structure like a BST) to hold multiple elements.

### **How it Works (Example)**:
Assume a hash function:  
\[
h(k) = k \mod 5
\]
For keys **{10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35}** in a **hash table of size 5**:

| **Index** | **Linked List (Chained Elements)** |
|----------|--------------------------------|
| 0        | 10 → 15 → 20 → 25 → 30 → 35  |
| 1        | -                              |
| 2        | -                              |
| 3        | -                              |
| 4        | -                              |

Each bucket stores a **linked list** of colliding elements.

### **Advantages**:
✔ **Efficient insertions and deletions** (no need for shifting elements).  
✔ **No limit on elements stored** (only dependent on available memory).  
✔ **Works well even when load factor > 1** (can store multiple elements in the same index).  

### **Disadvantages**:
✘ **Extra memory required** (due to linked list pointers).  
✘ **Poor cache performance** (linked lists may be scattered in memory).  
✘ **Increased search time** (searching inside a long linked list can take O(n) time in the worst case).  
✘ **Wasted space if chains are small or empty**.  

---

## **2. Open Addressing (Closed Hashing)**  
Unlike **separate chaining**, open addressing **stores all elements inside the table itself**. If a collision occurs, it searches for the next available slot using a **probing technique**.

### **Types of Open Addressing**:

### **2.1 Linear Probing**  
When a collision happens, **search for the next empty slot sequentially** (index + 1, index + 2, …).

### **How it Works (Example)**:
Assume a **hash function**:
\[
h(k) = k \mod 7
\]
For keys **{50, 700, 76, 85, 92}** in a **hash table of size 7**:

| **Key** | **h(k) = k mod 7** | **Placement (Linear Probing)** |
|--------|----------------|---------------------------|
| 50     | 50 mod 7 = 1  | Placed at index 1         |
| 700    | 700 mod 7 = 0 | Placed at index 0         |
| 76     | 76 mod 7 = 6  | Placed at index 6         |
| 85     | 85 mod 7 = 1  | Collision at 1 → Move to 2 |
| 92     | 92 mod 7 = 1  | Collision at 1, 2 → Move to 3 |

### **Advantages**:
✔ **Easy to implement** (simple linear search for empty slot).  
✔ **Cache-friendly** (all elements stored in contiguous memory).  

### **Disadvantages**:
✘ **Primary clustering** (groups of occupied slots form, making searches slow).  
✘ **Performance degrades as table fills up** (many collisions lead to long probing sequences).  
✘ **Table size must be large enough to avoid clustering**.  

---

### **2.2 Quadratic Probing**  
Instead of searching **sequentially**, **quadratic probing** checks positions using a quadratic function:
\[
h(k, i) = (h(k) + i^2) \mod m
\]
(where \(i\) is the probe number).

### **How it Works (Example)**:
For keys **{27, 18, 29, 28}** in a **table of size 10**,  
using **h(k) = k mod 10**:

| **Key** | **h(k) = k mod 10** | **Placement (Quadratic Probing)** |
|--------|----------------|---------------------------|
| 27     | 27 mod 10 = 7  | Placed at index 7         |
| 18     | 18 mod 10 = 8  | Placed at index 8         |
| 29     | 29 mod 10 = 9  | Placed at index 9         |
| 28     | 28 mod 10 = 8  | Collision at 8 → Try \(8 + 1^2 = 9\) (collision) → Try \(8 + 2^2 = 12\) → Index 2 |

### **Advantages**:
✔ **Reduces primary clustering** (better distribution of elements).  
✔ **Works better than linear probing when the table is moderately full**.  

### **Disadvantages**:
✘ **Secondary clustering** (keys with the same initial hash probe the same alternative locations).  
✘ **If table size is not a prime number, it may not find an empty slot**.  

---

### **2.3 Double Hashing**  
Instead of using a **fixed interval**, a **second hash function** determines the step size:
\[
h(k, i) = (h_1(k) + i \times h_2(k)) \mod m
\]

### **How it Works (Example)**:
For a **table of size 11**,  
using:
- \(h_1(k) = k \mod 11\)  
- \(h_2(k) = 7 - (k \mod 7)\)

| **Key** | **h₁(k)** | **h₂(k)** | **Placement** |
|--------|----------|----------|--------------|
| 47     | 47 mod 11 = 3  | 7 - (47 mod 7) = 4  | Index 3 |
| 39     | 39 mod 11 = 6  | 7 - (39 mod 7) = 3  | Index 6 |
| 24     | 24 mod 11 = 2  | 7 - (24 mod 7) = 2  | Index 2 |
| 55     | 55 mod 11 = 0  | 7 - (55 mod 7) = 4  | Index 0 |
| 67     | 67 mod 11 = 1  | 7 - (67 mod 7) = 3  | Collision → Try \( (1 + 1×3) \mod 11 = 4 \) |

### **Advantages**:
✔ **Best collision resolution for open addressing**.  
✔ **Avoids both primary and secondary clustering**.  

### **Disadvantages**:
✘ **Extra computation for second hash function**.  
✘ **Choosing a good second hash function is critical**.

## **Comparison Table**

| **Technique** | **Memory Usage** | **Search Time** | **Clustering** | **Extra Computation** |
|--------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Separate Chaining** | High (Linked Lists) | O(n) in worst case | No clustering | No extra computation |
| **Linear Probing** | Low | O(1) when empty, O(n) when full | **Primary Clustering** | No extra hash function |

| **Double Hashing** | Low | O(1) when empty, O(n) when full | No clustering | **Requires extra computation** |

## **Collision Resolution Techniques: Time Complexity Analysis**  

The time complexity of **collision resolution techniques** depends on **load factor (α = n/m)**, where:  
- **n** = Number of elements inserted  
- **m** = Size of the hash table  
- **α (Load Factor) = n/m** determines performance.  

### **1. Separate Chaining (Open Hashing)**  
Each index in the table contains a **linked list** (or other data structure like BST).  
- **Best Case (O(1))**: No collisions; the element is inserted/retrieved directly.  
- **Average Case (O(1 + α))**: Searching within a short chain.  
- **Worst Case (O(n))**: All elements hash to the same index, forming a **long linked list**.  

🔹 **Example**: If **α ≈ 1**, then the average search time is **O(2) ≈ O(1)**. However, if **α is high** (many collisions), search time can degrade to **O(n)**.  

---

### **2. Open Addressing (Closed Hashing)**  
Since all elements are stored **within the table**, searching involves **probing for an empty slot**.  

#### **2.1 Linear Probing**  
Checks for the **next available slot sequentially**.  
- **Best Case (O(1))**: No collision; element is inserted/retrieved at first attempt.  
- **Average Case (O(1/(1 - α)))**: Moderate collisions, but finds an empty slot quickly.  
- **Worst Case (O(n))**: Clustering occurs, requiring many probes.  

🔹 **Example**: If **α ≈ 0.5**, then average search time is **O(2)**; if **α ≈ 0.9**, search time is **O(10)**.  

---

#### **2.2 Quadratic Probing**  
Uses **quadratic jumps** instead of sequential searches.  
- **Best Case (O(1))**: No collision.  
- **Average Case (O(1/(1 - α)))**: Reduced primary clustering.  
- **Worst Case (O(n))**: If the table is poorly sized (non-prime), it may **fail to find an empty slot**.  

🔹 **Example**: If **α is low (< 0.5)**, quadratic probing performs well. But as **α increases**, it degrades similarly to linear probing.  

---

#### **2.3 Double Hashing**  
Uses a **second hash function** to determine probing sequence.  
- **Best Case (O(1))**: No collision.  
- **Average Case (O(1/(1 - α)))**: Fewer collisions than linear/quadratic probing.  
- **Worst Case (O(n))**: If **α is too high**, even double hashing struggles.  

🔹 **Example**: If **α is low (< 0.7)**, double hashing is **efficient**.

| **Linear Probing** | **O(1)** | **O(1 / (1 - α))** | **O(n)** (severe clustering) |
| **Quadratic Probing** | **O(1)** | **O(1 / (1 - α))** | **O(n)** (if table size is not prime) |
| **Double Hashing** | **O(1)** | **O(1 / (1 - α))** | **O(n)** (if α is too high) |

### **2. Functionality Differences**  
| **Feature**  | **Dictionaries**  | **General Hash Tables**  |
|-------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Data Structure**  | **High-level** key-value store, often built on top of a hash table | **Low-level** array-based data structure using hashing |
